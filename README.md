## data processing and single-cell RNA analysis tutorial

Before starting, you will need to do the following:
````
# Activate conda
source /mnt/sds-hd/sd25j001/miniconda3/bin/activate
# See all existing environments
conda env list
# THIS IS the environment for the practice today:
conda activate scRNAseq_env
# To use this environment in your Jupyter notebook, you need to create a python kernel while you are in the environment
python -m ipykernel install --user --name course_snRNAseq_env --display-name "Python (course_snRNAseq_env)"
```
